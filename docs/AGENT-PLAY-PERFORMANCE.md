# Agent play performance

Release 0.8.0 reduces reasoning round trips while preserving one physical
Codex body, one task lane, and honest Factorio mechanics.

## Recorded baseline and operating model

The accepted one-shot live baseline required **22 MCP calls** for the initial
mine/craft/place/fuel/inspect milestone. The September 2026 live run verified
the retained 0.8.0 path against Linux Factorio 2.0.77 with app/mod 0.8.0.

Use one persistent Sol-medium strategist and one persistent Luna-low pilot.
Sol batches reads and sends bounded milestones. Luna is the sole ordinary
action writer and executes knowable dependent actions with `run_plan`. This
removes model-thinking idle time; it does not accelerate walking, mining,
crafting, or any other game tick.

For each live benchmark, record the release SHA, milestone, MCP call count,
wall time, Factorio tick delta, completed/failed plan steps, final position and
inventory, and any `MCP_GAP`. Compare the same fresh-save milestone against the
22-call baseline. These measurements document completed bounded packets; they
do not imply continuing autonomous gameplay.

## Verified 0.8.0 structured timings

All gameplay perception and action below used the Factorio MCP text surface.
No screenshot, raw console, Lua, cheat, teleport, second body, or second task
lane was used.

| Milestone | MCP calls | Elapsed | Verified result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Initial connection and local state | 2 | 352 ms | `connect_status` took 109 ms and one radius-30 `observe_local` took 244 ms. Codex began at `(37.5859375, -63.4765625)` with stone 4 and iron plate 2. |
| Resource packet | 1 | 24.392 s | One `run_plan` completed 3/3: mine coal 5 at `(37.5, -63.5)`, walk to `(43.5, -68.5)`, then mine iron ore 5 at `(43.5, -70.5)`. The final observation reported `(42.671875, -68.1171875)` with coal 5, stone 4, iron ore 5, and iron plate 2. |
| Furnace inspection | 1 | 2.114 s | `inspect_entity` with `positions: [{x: 31, y: -56}]` found a healthy stone furnace, `no_ingredients`, with coal 1 in fuel. An earlier packet using removed `targets` was correctly rejected by the public schema before runtime. |
| Smelting packet | 1 | 19.458 s | One `run_plan` completed 3/3: insert iron ore 5, wait up to 60 seconds for five output plates, then extract iron plate 5. The final observation reported `(37.62890625, -63.37109375)` with coal 5, stone 4, and iron plate 7. |

The pilot consumed each `run_plan.observation` as the authoritative final state
and made no redundant observe or inspect call after either packet. Keep one
persistent pilot for successive packets. A fresh Luna-low or Luna-medium child
may produce an empty bootstrap turn; reuse a previously `AVAILABLE` connected
child and never bypass repository ownership or create another action writer.

## Durable discovery rule

Prefer an existing batched read or exact positional action. A repeatable task
should become a bounded `run_plan` input, not new Lua orchestration. If a tool
lacks state required for a correct decision, stop with `MCP_GAP`: objective,
missing field, current tool, why it is needed, and the smallest structured
addition. Add durable MCP state only after that concrete gap is reproduced;
never infer it from screenshots, by-name search, or hidden global state.

## Research patterns

- [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291): adopt reusable bounded skills
  and feedback after execution. Reject open-ended self-directed curricula,
  generated game code, and a second model loop inside the product.
- [Mineflayer Pathfinder](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer-pathfinder):
  adopt explicit goals and reusable physical pathfinding. Reject teleporting,
  direct world mutation, and a parallel movement implementation.
- [LLM-PySC2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05348): adopt compact textual
  observations, structured actions, and strategist/pilot separation. Reject
  image input, multi-body control, and population-scaled agent orchestration.
- [Factorio Learning Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09617): adopt
  long-horizon benchmark discipline and honest failure reporting. Reject its
  code-synthesis REPL, privileged game access, free resources, and benchmark
  machinery as runtime dependencies.

The retained design is deliberately smaller: MCP synchronously sequences
existing tools, Lua continues to own only physical tasks, and every terminal
plan path attempts one compact local observation.
